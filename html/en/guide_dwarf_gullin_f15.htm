<html><head><body>Hey, look at you! You've been making some excellent progress, my friend! I'm going to teach you some new things now, since you're ready to train in the Spine Mines. What you have to learn now is <font color="LEVEL">how to cooperate with other adventurers</font>.<br>This is a turning point of your life, because at Level 10 you're able to learn some basic Dwarven skills: <font color="LEVEL">Create Item</font>, which lets you create items using recipes, and <font color="LEVEL">Spoil</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Search</font>, which let you collect raw materials from monsters. You must learn how to make the most of these skills.<br>Acquiring these skills is the most important thing for you to accomplish right now. You can go and try to figure everything out on your own if you want, or I could give you a couple tips, eh?<br><a action="link guide_dwarf_gullin_f15_01.htm">What should I do now?</a><br><a action="link guide_dwarf_gullin_f15_02.htm">What is the best equipment for me?</a><br><a action="link guide_dwarf_gullin_f15_03.htm">What is the best hunting site for me?</a><br><a action="link guide_dwarf_gullin_f15_04.htm">Tell me about skills.</a><br><a action="link guide_dwarf_gullin_f15_05.htm">Which quests are available to me?</a></body></html>
