I recommend these weapons to Mystics, who do not have the training to be highly accurate in combat, or to any warrior who values consistency in battle.<br>As you advance, you can acquire skills specifically for blunt weapons. Something else to keep in mind about these weapons is that they have greater damage range than other weapon types.
