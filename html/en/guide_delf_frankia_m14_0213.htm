<font color="LEVEL">One-handed blunt weapons</font> have a higher accuracy than other weapons. However, their chance to inflict critical damage is much lower. Blunt weapons are designed to <font color="LEVEL">reliably deal predictable amounts of damage</font>. This is the reason they are the first weapons a Mystic learns.
<br>
As you advance, you can acquire skills specifically for blunt weapons. Something to keep in mind about blunt weapons is that they have greater damage range than other weapon types. For example, a blunt weapon with an average attack power of 10 has a damage range of 7 to 13, whereas a sword with the same average power has a range of 9 to 11.
