Sir Gustaf Athebaldt:
<br>
The royal authority at the center has already been shaken to the core.  And the authority of lords and aristocrats has fallen a long time ago.    The bloody uprising of peasants that broke out a few years ago in Dion is the proof.  In the midst of this chaos, several small power circles are growing their strength trying to grasp a big piece of the pie for themselves.
<br>
I believe that a young and energetic lord like yourself should lead in a new era.  Rather than counting on the old royal circle of influence, I would rather lend my power to new blood like you guys.  I’ll be your strong supporter.  What do you say?  Would you like to join forces with me?
