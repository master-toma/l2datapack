<html><head><body>At level 6, your most important task is to find better weapons. Consider the weapon you are wielding now, then think how you wish to improve.<br>If you prefer hand-to-hand combat, seek to obtain <font color="LEVEL">spiked gloves</font>. Iron gloves are even better, but will be quite expensive. Spiked gloves will do. If you prefer the sword, buy a <font color="LEVEL">small sword</font>, or a broadsword if you have the adena to spend. If blunt weapons suit you, you'll do fine with a <font color="LEVEL">club</font>. Blunt weapons have a high accuracy, and those who use them may learn stun skills.<br>Whatever you choose for close combat, try to get a bow as well, if you can. Bows allow you to draw monsters to you by attacking them from a distance.<br>Around level 9 or 10 you should have enough adena to purchase better weapons, but you might want to wait awhile, until you've performed a quest for the Chiefs that relates to weapons.<br><a action="link guide_orc_tanai_f10_021.htm">I want to know about the characteristics of each weapon type.</a><br><a action="link guide_orc_tanai_f10_022.htm">I want to know about armor.</a><br><a action="link guide_orc_tanai_f10.htm">Return</a></body></html>
