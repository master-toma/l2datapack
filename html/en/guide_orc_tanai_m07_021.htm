Listen closely, this is very important knowledge for a Mystic like yourself. Armor is divided into robes, light armor and heavy armor. Mystics may wear armor of any type, but different types of armor will affect your abilities differently. Mystics of the weaker races mostly wear robes, but an Orc Mystic like yourself has more flexible rules.
<br>
When I refer to a set of armor, it means that the upper and lower body armor is of the same type. <font color="LEVEL">Robes provides little protection, but when worn by Mystics they increase casting and movement speed, and even increase MP.</font> With light or heavy armor, defense is increased, but while casting, your speed, movement and MP are all worse than they would be with robes. Light armor doesn't affect your movement speed, but heavy armor does. Of course, heavy armor provides more protection. Both heavy and light armor increase your casting time and reduce your MP equally.
<br>
These penalties apply only to upper and lower body armor ... helmets, gloves and other protective items do not cause penalties. With such items, feel free to use the strongest you can find.
