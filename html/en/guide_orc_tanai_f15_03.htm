The most popular hunting ground for Fighters of your level is the region of the <font color="LEVEL">Frozen Waterfalls</font> to the east of the town's north road. At levels 11 and 12, hunt werewolves and bats for awhile longer before trying the waterfalls. When you reach level 14, you can go to the waterfalls and hunt grizzlies and greystone golems. Golems are tough to deal with if you don't have enough magic defense, but they can be killed if you use skills like Power Strike to strike them down before they can counter-attack, or learn to use your iron fist skill with the proper timing to disrupt their attempts to use magic.

If you think the falls are too difficult or too crowded, take the southern road from the village and go towards the east. Any time you reach a fork in the road, take the right-hand path. Where the road turns north you'll find a good hunting ground for evil eyes and bats.
