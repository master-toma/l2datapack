Priest Prim:
<br>
You who seek divine truth, welcome to the Temple of Einhasad.
<br>
Currently, Giran has never had such peace and abundance. However, in these times we must guard against the throngs of darkness that would seek to corrupt the souls of good people.
<br>
The magic of light that the Gods have allowed us to share must be used to punish these dark powers. This is our destiny!
