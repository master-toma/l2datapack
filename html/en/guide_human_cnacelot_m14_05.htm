<html><head><body>Many of the villagers could use your help, and there are plenty of quests out there for your level. They can be an excellent boost to your training.<br>Now <font color="LEVEL">Master Minia</font> of the Fighter Guild is a very strange ... that is to say, a unique person. She has this hobby of collecting unique weapons, and she's been asking around for help. You could be of service.<br>Also, visit <font color="LEVEL">Grand Master Roien</font> in Cedric's Training Hall.

I understand it involves a sword that figures in the histories of both the Humans and the Elves ... it sounds important. You should go get the whole story from him.<br>I think <font color="LEVEL">Grand Sorcerer Gallint</font> of Einhovant's School could also use some help. Apparently the spirit of mirrors escaped during his research.<br><a action="link guide_human_cnacelot_m14.htm">Return</a></body></html>
