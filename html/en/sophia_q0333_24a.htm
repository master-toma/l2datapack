Mercenary Sophia:

Red foot…  you may not like him much personally.  But he is the type of person who is missed when he is not around.  Although he is in charge of delivery of military supplies, he also works on the side as a broker of stolen war trophies and loot.  He is also a great source of information for our mercenary troops.  Since he brings with him quite a lot of useful information, stop by often to ask him questions.
