<html><head><body>It's time for you to learn about magic items. I'm sure that by now you've used lesser healing potions, but there's far more that you must know about if you plan to succeed.<br>It is time that you began to acquire <font color="LEVEL">accessories</font>. This is the general term for items that increase your magic defense. Soon you will face magic users like the stone golems in combat.

This magic scroll instantly transports you to the nearest village. If your favorite hunting ground is far from a village, the scroll can save you all the travel time used in returning.

The scroll isn't cheap at your level, but once you've used it a few times, you'll begin to appreciate its value.<br><a action="link guide_human_cnacelot_f15_02.htm">Return</a></body></html>
