Hunter Union Member Colin:<br>The town's geographical features? Oh my... What a lazy chap. Have you no legs?<br>Even if you already know, the town is to the north-west, and to the south-east... It is divided up into 2 large areas like this. The shops are lined up above, and several guilds are situated on the bottom. These 2 areas are divided by a great canyon, and if you happen to fall into it, you will have a hard time climbing back up. So be careful.<br>There are 2 bridges that connect the northern and southern part of the town. In the past, the King accused us being of being a band of bandits. When he came to subjugate us, my grandfather and father disconnected the two bridges and fought for over 3 months until the King gave up. It was Duke Athebaldt, who made peace between the Hunters' Union and the King.<br>Why..., you do know, right? Did you not know? The son of the Duke is a Guildmaster at our town. I'm talking about Aren! He is quite a nice guy, even though he is from a noble family...<br><a action="link union_member_colin001.htm">Return</a></body></html>
