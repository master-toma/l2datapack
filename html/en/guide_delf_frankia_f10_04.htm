What are the offensive skills that you are using already? Once you choose a skill, it is better to concentrate on developing that skill, than on acquiring new ones. After Level 10, you may increase your skills. Upgrade the ones you already use most.
<br>
As a rule, after you increase an offensive skill it is wise to learn supplemental skills which increase your abilities. If you have obtained <font color="LEVEL">Aura Defense</font>, which increases your defense, learning <font color="LEVEL">Aura Attack</font>, which increases your attack power, is a prudent choice.
<br>
And be sure to learn either <font color="LEVEL">Armor Mastery</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Weapon Mastery</font>. Which you choose depends on your tastes, but personally I would advise obtaining Weapon Mastery first. There is little enough difference, though, as long as you have one or the other.
