Guard Bret:
<br>
It's just a country. I mean, what more is there to say? Generally, they say that it is the Godard territory of Elmore. There's also a village called Godard Village and it seems to have become really impoverished due to the war. The citizens are starving... But as they are still planning to attack our Aden again and have put up huge castles, I really feel bad for the people that live there...
<br>
Right after the war, our situation here in Aden was pretty bad too but thanks to the quick handling of His Royal Highness Amadeo, we've been able to recover like this. When I think of him whose age is even younger than me, I can only say that he's simply amazing...
