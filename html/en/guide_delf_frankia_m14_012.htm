<html><head><body>It requires serious preparation to be an effective part of a group. Experience is the best teacher, but I can tell you some of the basics.<br>First, for now it matters little whether you hunt with Fighters or with other Mystics. The most important thing right now is that you <font color="LEVEL">find people you trust and work well with.</font><br>Second, when you look at your party in the compass, or <font color="LEVEL">radar</font>, on the top right of the screen, notice that your party members will be marked with <font color="LEVEL">green dots</font>. Also, at the left side of your screen, <font color="LEVEL">you may double-click the Party window to move towards a nearby member.</font> <font color="LEVEL">By double-clicking one of your party members, you will automatically follow the one you have chosen.</font><br>A monster usually concentrates its attacks on the person who has injured it the most. Therefore, if you are using powerful magic in a group of Fighters, the target may charge you. That is not what you wish to happen. So, <font color="LEVEL">use attack magic to finish the target, after the Fighters have weakened it.</font><br>Finally, monsters may also turn on those who are helping their attackers. Be just as careful when using Heal, Might or Shield as you are when you cast attack magic.<br><a action="link guide_delf_frankia_m14_01.htm">Return</a></body></html>
