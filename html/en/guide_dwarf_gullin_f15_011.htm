<html><head><body>Let's talk about forming a <font color="LEVEL">party</font>, a group of adventurers to hunt and travel with. Parties are created using <font color="LEVEL">Invite</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Action</font> tab (<font color="LEVEL">ALT + C</font>) of your Character Status window. First, click on the character you wish to invite into your party, then click the Invite icon. Next time you go hunting, you should try to form a party with another adventurer this way.<br>If you are having difficulty finding party members, use the <font color="LEVEL">Party Matching</font> button in the Action tab of your Character Status window. This will display a list of adventurers who also want to form parties. You can use Invite, Whisper, or other useful commands from this window.<br>This is the point in your career where you decide whether you are a "tiger" who likes to hunt alone, or a "lion" who prefers the company of a group. If you're a tiger, you will need to perfect strategies to ensure your own survival, while a lion must learn how best to serve the interests of the group.<br><a action="link guide_dwarf_gullin_f15_0111.htm">I want to fight on my own.</a><br><a action="link guide_dwarf_gullin_f15_0112.htm">I want to fight in groups.</a><br><a action="link guide_dwarf_gullin_f15.htm">Return</a></body></html>
