<html><head><body>Duelist Kaien:<br>First you must slay the <font color="LEVEL">excuro</font> and the <font color="LEVEL">krator</font> from the <font color="LEVEL">Cruma Tower</font>. As a proof of your victory, bring back 3 Excuro Skins and 3 Krator Fragments. I trust that I don't need  to explain about the dangers of the Cruma Tower?<br>After this you must go to the <font color="LEVEL">Corridor of Death</font> in Giran and fight the <font color="LEVEL">Grandis</font>. Perhaps you have already heard of the savagery of the Grandis? <br>Next find the <font color="LEVEL">Timak Orc Bladedancer</font> from the <font color="LEVEL">southern region of Oren</font> and challenge him. The Timak Orcs are a strong race, strong enough to hold their own against the guards of the Oren Lord. Furthermore, your opponent is the Bladedancer, so it will be best to view his skills as equal to that of the strongest warrior.<br>Finally, you must slay the <font color="LEVEL">larkin</font> that wanders through all of <font color="LEVEL">Aden</font>. It is a giant, violent animal, so make sure you are prepared. It would be good to have a trusted friend watching your back.<br>These orders contain a list of the opponents you must defeat, so consult them if needed.</body></html>
