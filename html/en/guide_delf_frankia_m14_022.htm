What do you do with your old weapons when you buy new ones? Do you sell them to a store?  You might receive a better price if you sell them to other players.<br>Likewise, you can often buy gear for a better price from other players.<br>Press the <font color="LEVEL">Trade</font> tab on the bottom left of the Chat window. You will probably find it to be filled with messages from adventurers like yourself, buying and selling goods. Try making your next purchase from one of them.

<br>
For the <font color="LEVEL">Sell</font> option, execute the Sell action, then select the item you wish to sell. Set its price and enter a message, then press Start. It sells itself automatically, which comes in very handy.

And for the <font color="LEVEL">Buy</font> option, execute the Buy action, then select the item you wish to buy, its price, and quantity, then press Start. But if you do not currently possess the item you wish to buy, you will not be able to purchase that item. Dwarves may register up to 5 different items on the Buy list, while other races may register up to 4 items.<br><img src="icon.action018" width="32" height="32"><br>Private Store Action Icon<br><a action="link guide_delf_frankia_m14_02.htm">Return</a></body></html>
