I believe <font color="LEVEL">Balor Orcs and walking fungi</font> are suitable prey for your skills. They can easily be found in the south reaches of the Dark Forest.
<br>
Which reminds me, you must soon complete the <font color="LEVEL">Orc Subjugation</font> quest given by Sentry Kayleen. You will gain valuable experience hunting Orcs.
<br>
Be very cautious of the marshes to the south; this region may be too dangerous for you. Undead creatures lurk in the swamp. You may be ready for the swamp when you reach Level 11. Until then, I advise you to avoid it.
