Have you gained a combat skill yet? You'll recall I advised either Power Strike or Mortal Blow, depending on your choice of weapon. There's no need to learn both.
<br>
As a rule, novices acquire an attack skill first, and then learn <font color="LEVEL">Relax</font>, a healing skill. After that, they learn passive skills like <font color="LEVEL">Weapon Mastery</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Armor Mastery</font>. It is, of course, your choice to make, but my personal preference is to obtain Weapon Mastery first. Either skill will come in useful, though.
<br>
You may upgrade the skills you have learned when you reach level 10. It is wise, of course, to increase the skills you're already using most.
<br>
You will find that learning to effectively use a bow will make a great difference in the way you hunt, but doing so will require both adena and MP, so choose your training wisely.
