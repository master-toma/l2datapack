<html><head><body>If you use your head while hunting, you should have about 60 SP by the time you reach level 5. <font color="LEVEL">Master Pintage</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Master Gwinter</font> can tell you the skills in which you can train.<br>Skills are divided into active skills and passive skills. <font color="LEVEL">Active skills</font> require that you intentionally use them, while <font color="LEVEL">passive skills</font> increase your basic abilities from the moment you learn them. When you reach level 5, you'll want to learn active offensive skills first. <font color="LEVEL">Power Strike, Mortal Blow, and Power Shot</font> are your choices. Power Strike is for those who fight with a <font color="LEVEL">sword</font>, Mortal Blow for <font color="LEVEL">dagger</font> fighters, and Power Shot for those who use the <font color="LEVEL">bow</font>. Power Shot deals a great deal of damage, but also consumes a great quantity of MP, so it has to be used wisely.<br>Make sure you choose the skill you really want.<br><a action="link guide_human_cnacelot_f05.htm">Return</a></body></html>
