How did you know that my hobby was relic restoration? But with relics like tablets on which words are written, we can't read them if there is even one piece missing and so there's really no point in just putting the other pieces together. In my experience, square-shaped relics like stone tablets often break into <font color="LEVEL">four pieces</font>.
