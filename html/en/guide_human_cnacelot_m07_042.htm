<html><head><body>I recommend that you train the Wind Strike spell to level 2 by the time you reach level 7. At that point, if you have enough SP, you should raise it all the way to level 3.<br>If Wind Strike doesn't suit you for some reason, consider a level 1 Ice Bolt. This spell will slow your target's movement rate, and can be a great aid to successful hunting.<br><a action="link guide_human_cnacelot_m07_04.htm">Return</a></body></html>
