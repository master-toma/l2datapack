<html><head><body>It's never too early to think about your long-term goals. The Kingdom of Aden is in chaos, because they are at war with Elmore to the north and Gracia across the sea. Remember, <font color="LEVEL">there are always opportunities during times of chaos</font>. Now you are merely a novice Mystic, but if you train hard and learn much, there is nothing to stop you from becoming a lord or a king.<br>You must begin by familiarizing yourself with the gear you already have. Whether you seek to become a dragon slayer or the lord of a castle, or even a force for world peace, it all begins with your training here.<br>Start out by hunting keltirs or wolves around the village.

If you have no other use for them, you can always sell them at a shop.<br><a action="link guide_human_cnacelot_m07.htm">Return</a></body></html>
