They will offer you an assignment when you click on <font color="LEVEL">Quest</font>.<br>They will not ask you to perform a quest which is beyond your abilities, so if they refuse to offer a task, it means that your level is too low to provide a reasonable chance of success.<br> You should also know that there are quests that you may only perform once, but there are also repeating quests that you may complete several times.<br><a action="link guide_delf_frankia_f05_051.htm">I want to know more about the quests.</a><br><a action="link guide_delf_frankia_f05.htm">Return</a></body></html>
