Master Terry:
<br>
Oh my! This letter is from Master Dufner... Yes, I am the murderer who was once called the 'Hawk Eye'. But the Hawk Eye is already dead. You can't come and ask me to revive the Hawk Eye now... That is too much. ...Well in fact he is the only person who can ask me such a thing... For he is the very person who helped me abandon the Hawk Eye and settle down in this town...
