<html><head><body>Peter:<br>Please help the farmers who lost their way of living recover their land from the orcs. As I told you, kill the turek orcs and bring their necklaces back as proof, and I will give you a reward.<br>Also, do not discard the ancient relics that the orcs keep with them. Collect them all. You can sell them for quite a high price at the village. Why don't you think of it as a kind of bonus for this task?<br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=327&reply=1">Say you will quit</a><br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=327&reply=2">Say you will continue</a></body></html>
