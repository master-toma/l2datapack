Hierarch Asterios:
<br>
Welcome, son of Human. I am Asterios, the chosen representative of Eva, the mother of all forests and nymphs. Of the 12 chosen hierarchs, I am the only one remaining on this land to rule over the Elves of light in place of the final sovereign, Valderan. What has brought you to me?
