Master Cobendell:
<br>
So Smallberry sent you. I don't know if you are aware of it, but recently Mystics from the Ivory Tower have been working together with the top Spellsingers of our race to purify the <font color="LEVEL">Sea of Spores</font> of the poison that fills it, and return it to the lush, beautiful woods it once was.
<br>
Recently the Spellsinger Adria Lumingshine and her escort of Sentinels travelled to the Sea of Spores to conduct research.
