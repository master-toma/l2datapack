Sentinel Rayen:
<br>
You have fought well for the brothers of the forest. I will give you a reward for each piece of proof you have brought from slaying kaboo orcs in the battlefield. I am giving this in the name of our Hierarch Asterios, so please do not refuse our gift.
<br>
Now! Shall you go back to the battlefield and fight once more? Or do you wish to stop? Even if you say that you are exhausted in mind and body, I will not fault or scold you.
