<br>
At last you have reached level 19! Congratulations!
<br>
You may select your first professional upgrade at level 19. However, you must reach <font color="LEVEL">level 20</font> for the change to actually take effect, no matter which quest you are on.
<br>
A Dwarven Fighter may change to a Raider or an Artisan. For further information go visit the <font color="LEVEL">Head Blacksmiths</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Warehouse Chiefs</font> of the nearest village.
<br>
The Warehouse Chiefs are in charge of professional changes to a Raider. They can be found at warehouses. Head Blacksmiths are in charge of Artisans. They will be at the blacksmith shops.
