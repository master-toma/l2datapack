<html><head><body>Have you considered the next weapon you wish to purchase? Broadswords are mere children's toys to you now.

You should be able to obtain a much better price by dealing with other adventurers.<br>Let me draw your attention to the <font color="LEVEL">short spear</font>, a polearm that is well suited to these levels. Polearms are very slow to wield, but they allow you to attack several enemies at once.
