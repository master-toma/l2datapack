Rylin:<br>What is a Dwarf doing here in a remote island? You came here to see me?<br><font color="LEVEL">The Mark of Health</font>? I heard news that my lover who I had been waiting for for a thousand years died a few days ago...Can't you see my grief?...

You are so selfish...!<br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=221&reply=1">Give the brooch as a present</a></body></html>
