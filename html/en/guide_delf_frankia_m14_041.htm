<html><head><body>When fighting in a party, your Fighters have the responsibility of fighting face to face with the enemy. You can hurl attack spells, but it is equally important for you to support your Fighters with healing and strengthening spells.<br>To effectively support them, make sure you have <font color="LEVEL">Heal</font> to at least Level 2, and then enhance <font color="LEVEL">Might</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Shield</font>. Until you reach Level 14, use <font color="LEVEL">Weapon Mastery</font> to strengthen your Fighters. <font color="LEVEL">Heal</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Battle Heal</font> are more important in party combat than offensive spells.<br>If you wish to use attack magic, you must continue to develop your Wind Strike spell even after Level 14. But remember that party combat only works as long as the Fighters are able to stand up to the enemy, so I advise you not to neglect Heal, Might and Shield.<br><a action="link guide_delf_frankia_m14_04.htm">Return</a></body></html>
