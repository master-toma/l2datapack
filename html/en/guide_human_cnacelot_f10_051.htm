<font color="LEVEL">Captain Gilbert</font> recently received a message from the Lord of Gludio by way of Sir Windawood, I understand. I believe he could use your assistance.
<br>
And there's that master of yours with the odd... that is, unique... hobby of collecting novel weapons -- I speak of <font color="LEVEL">Master Minia</font>. She's in need of help with her endeavors.
<br>
And it's once again time for you to pay a call on <font color="LEVEL">Grand Master Roien</font> at Cedric's Training Hall. I believe he recently received some valuable information from the library at Einhovant's School of Wizardry. It concerns a sword that figures in the histories of both Humans and Elves... It sounds like it could be important, so do not delay.
<br>
If you need more to keep you busy, make the rounds of the village and find out what else is available on your own. You could probably drop by the temple -- there's always something to do around there.
