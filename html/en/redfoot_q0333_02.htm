Mercenary Red Foot:
<br>
Hey brother!  Did you tell me that you’re currently on active duty?  I know that must be hard work!  Is there anything I can help you with?
<br>
What kind of box is that…?  Oh, I know.  That’s a cargo box used by traders.  Since you brought it to me…  I can assume that you don’t have any intention of returning it to the merchant, am I right?  All right.  I’ll open the box for you.  Of course, you can have the contents of the box.  Instead, I’ll charge you a small fee.  I think <font color="LEVEL">650 adena</font> will be appropriate.  Think of it as the price for opening the box and for keeping my mouth shut.
