Abyssal Celebrant Undrias:
<br>
That statue is a sacred object for us dark elves.  Anyway, if you keep it for yourself, you won’t have much use for it.  Furthermore, if you carry a statue of Shilen with you and walk around among humans, people will accuse you of being a pagan.  You would be lucky if you are not burnt to death at the stake.  Anyway, if you change your mind, please come back and see me.  If you hand over the statue to me, I am willing to pay you a generous sum of reward money.  Well,  then may the divine protection of abyss be with you.
