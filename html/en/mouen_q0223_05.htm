Captain Mouen:<br>We're in trouble! <font color="LEVEL">It turned out to be that the road scavengers that you got rid of were merely an instrument of the leto lizardmen!</font> There is news that the leto lizards are planning a large scale attack on Giran Castle.

Please join them in the fight!<br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=223&reply=3">"I will join the fight!"</a></body></html>
