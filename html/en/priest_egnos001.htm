Priest Egnos:
<br>
May the blessings of Einhasad and Eva be with you!
<br>
Well come to the Temple of Light. I am Egnos, God's servant.
<br>
I think Bishop Hollint has something on his mind these days. If you need any help please don't bother him and come to me or Father Vardin. I will do my best to serve you.
