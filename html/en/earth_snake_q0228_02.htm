Ahhh, the thousand year flower! I see… So you seek the golden seed and the 4 elemental notes, then?
<br>
Well, I guess it doesn't matter... Yes, I will give you the Note of the Earth. But you must find out something for me first.
<br>
In that place that the Humans call Oren, near the Ivory Tower, I have seen monsters.  They seem similar to those from the place called Gludio, but much stronger than any that I have ever seen... Why is this happening? I must know!
