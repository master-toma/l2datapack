Have you gained a combat skill yet?
<br>
As a rule, novices acquire an attack skill first, and then learn <font color="LEVEL">Rest in Peace</font>, a healing skill, and then passive skills like <font color="LEVEL">Weapon Mastery</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Armor Mastery.</font> It is, of course, your choice to make, but my personal preference is to obtain Weapon Mastery first. Either skill will come in useful, though.
<br>
You may upgrade the skills you have learned when you reach level 10. It is wise, of course, to increase the skills you're already using most.
<br>
You will find that learning to effectively use a bow will make a great difference in the way you hunt, but doing so will require both adena and MP. Though I must say, it is not a weapon well suited for us Orcs.
