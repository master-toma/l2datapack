Mercenary Sophia:<br>Hello traveler with a fresh face.  It’s nice to meet you.  My name is Sophia, commander of the 4th platoon of the Black Lion Mercenary Troop.

But the evil spirits in this area are too numerous for our platoon to deal with by ourselves and we are struggling right now.<br>If you are planning to travel to Gludio or Giran region, you had better prepare yourself for an attack by an Enku Orc or a Dire Wolf.
