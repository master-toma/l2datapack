<font color="LEVEL">One-handed blunt weapons</font> are the traditional arms of us Dwarves. Their accuracy is higher than other weapon types, but their chance of inflicting critical damage is much lower. Blunt weapons <font color="LEVEL">reliably deliver consistent damage</font>.
<br>
As you advance, you'll be able to learn skills that only work with blunt weapons. Something else that's interesting about blunt weapons -- they have a greater range of damage than other types. Say you have two different types of weapon with an average attack power of 10. The blunt weapon might do 7 to 13 points per attack, while the sword might do 9 to 11.
