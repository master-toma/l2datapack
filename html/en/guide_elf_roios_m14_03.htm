Take your apprentice's spellbook, or whatever you are using, and head southeast of the village to hunt <font color="LEVEL">Kaboo Orcs</font>, or <font color="LEVEL">Kaboo Orc grunts</font> until you are ready to improve your weapons.
<br>
If you upgrade your weapons at level 9 or 10, you might venture farther to the southeast and cross the two bridges to find the region of the <font color="LEVEL">green dryads</font>. If you travel southwest and across the river, you will find more Kaboo Orc grunts to challenge. Take care -- they are aggressive, and will attack you before you attack them, unlike most other monsters.
<br>
From level 10 to level 13, you will hunt in the areas where your quests take you. Hunt what monsters you can while completing such quests as the <font color="LEVEL">"Sea of Spores Fever"</font> quest, or the <font color="LEVEL">"Skirmish with the Orcs"</font> quest. You will be told where to go by the Elves who bestow the quests upon you.
