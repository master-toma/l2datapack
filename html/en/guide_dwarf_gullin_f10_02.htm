At Level 6, finding the right weapon is your most important task. What weapon are you using the most now? Are you sure it's the one you really want? Now we Dwarves are naturally fond of blunt weapons, but I suppose at your age you're wanting to try all sorts of new things.
<br>
If a dagger's to your taste, buy a <font color="LEVEL">bone dagger.</font> A doomed dagger would be even better, if you happen to have the money, but a bone dagger will serve well enough. If you're a traditionalist who wants to stay with blunt weapons, then a <font color="LEVEL">club</font> will do you nicely. Blunt weapons have a high hit rate, but most importantly we Dwarves have skills that can only be used with blunt weapons. If it's swords you're wanting, get yourself a <font color="LEVEL">small sword</font>, or perhaps a broadsword if you have the money for it.
<br>
Whatever else you choose, get a bow when you can. A bow lets you draw monsters to you, by attacking them from a distance.
<br>
You'll have some extra money by the time you reach Level 9 or 10, so that's a good time to buy a better weapon.
