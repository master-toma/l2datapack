Hunter Union President Bernard:<br>Welcome to the Hunters' Village, young friend. As you know, our village was first formed by Hunters. But we do not stop other Hunters from hunting near our town. We must help each other, don't you think so too?<br>However, there are too many young Hunters these days who disregard the rules... Even pointlessly fighting in the village... To prevent any clashes I hope you follow these rules.<br>Never hunt what another Hunter is hunting. And never take what another Hunter has captured... Easy eh? I think these are the most basic rules not only Hunters but every Human being must follow. Don't you think so?<br>I will kick the person who breaks these easy rules out of the village...<br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest</a></body></html>
