Orim of the Shadow:
<br>
I command thee, devil trapped in the prison of spirits! I speak in the name of Gran Kain, ruler of all darkness that thou shall return to where you come from!
<br>
Chain of heaven which ties up the evil creatures of shadow, I order you in the name of Einhasad's light, may the sealing of the seraph restrict the evil spirit forever!
<br>
The spell is now done. Hurry! The key!
