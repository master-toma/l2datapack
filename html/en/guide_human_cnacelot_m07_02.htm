Your apprentice's staff is effective until level 5 or so. Try to save around 1,000 adena by then, so you can purchase an <font color="LEVEL">apprentice's rod</font>. You can make use of the armor you obtain from monsters, of course, but this depends entirely on luck. If you reached level 5 and you do not yet have gloves, shoes or a helmet, you may wish to acquire the cheapest ones offered at the store.
