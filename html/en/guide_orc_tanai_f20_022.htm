Upper and lower body armor are classified as either <font color="LEVEL">robes</font>, <font color="LEVEL">light gear</font> or <font color="LEVEL">heavy gear</font>. Robes are for Mystics and that ilk, so we'll skip them and move directly to light and heavy gear.
<br>
When you reach level 20, and change occupations, the armor you wear can influence certain skills. For example, the Orc Marauder's Heavy Armor Mastery is a skill which increases defense only when heavy gear is worn. Likewise, the Paagrio Monk's Light Armor Mastery increases evasive abilities only when wearing light gear.
<br>
Keep in mind, you are only considered to be equipped with a given type of armor if <font color="LEVEL">both the upper and lower body is equipped with the same armor type</font>. Heavy Armor Mastery, for example, will not have any effect if you are equipped with, say, a bronze breastplate and leather pants.
<br>
These skills are only affected by your upper and lower body armor. Your helmet, gloves and other gear do not signify, so wear what you wish in those locations.
