For adventurers of your level, the <font color="LEVEL">Marshlands</font>, south of the village, are very popular hunting grounds, as is the area around the <font color="LEVEL">School of Dark Arts</font>. You can effectively increase your level by defeating <font color="LEVEL">marsh zombies</font> or <font color="LEVEL">skeleton hunters</font>.
<br>
One rule that always holds true -- the farther from the village you venture, the stronger the enemies you will meet. Therefore, as your level increases, you should hunt farther away from the village. If travel time is becoming an inconvenience, you may use the gatekeeper to take you to the outpost where <font color="LEVEL">Twyla</font> lives. This is in the southern part of the forest, where strong monsters can be found.
