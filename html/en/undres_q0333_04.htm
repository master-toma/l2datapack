Abyssal Celebrant Undrias:<br>Due to the humans’ distorted religious reformation, our goddess that we worship has been misunderstood to be a sinister being that brings death and destruction.  But we dark elves still worship Shilen as our creator and as a goddess who is in charge of life and death.  Unfortunately, when this place was invaded by the allied forces of humans and elves, many sacred objects which were decorating the temple were lost.  Especially, many statues of the goddess Shilen which were exquisitely crafted were stolen.  The statue you brought here is one of the statues that were lost at that time.  Thank you so much.  Here is the reward money I promised you.  If you find any more statues like this, please bring them to me.  Well,  then may the divine protection of abyss be with you!</body></html>
