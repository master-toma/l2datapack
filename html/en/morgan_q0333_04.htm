Guild Member Morgan:
<br>
You've gotten another freight box. I'm thankful again. The freight that is being looted by the evil creatures is increasing by the day but without the help of mercenaries like yourself, the losses of our commercial guild would be so much more. Here, take this gift of gratitude!. And, as always, I present you with these <font color="LEVEL">coins from our guild</font>. Please keep up the good work in the future too!
