Sir Gustaf Athebaldt:
<br>
It’s nice to meet you young man.  My name is Gustaf Athebaldt.  I am a knight of the royal bodyguards.  Although I will soon retire, when I see the current state of affairs, I worry so much about the future of this kingdom that I don’t think I will be able to retire comfortably...
<br>
I don’t think I can trust the future of this nation in the hands of kings or lords.  Lords are always busy pursuing and satisfying their own self-interest and gratification.  And the king always looks away from his people’s hardships.  So, how would you expect them to be concerned about the nation’s welfare?  If you think idly that it does not matter who rules over the country, you will find yourself in no time groaning under the harsh tyranny of a despot.
<br>
In my opinion, although we may have to go through hellish wars and tribulations, we must restore the order of the nation.
