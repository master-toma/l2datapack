As I've told you before, <font color="LEVEL">refining your profession</font> is the most important thing right now. You're about to become an <font color="LEVEL">Orc Shaman</font>. Visit the House of the King and ask <font color="LEVEL">Paagrio Lord Kakai</font> for further guidance.
<br>
But remember, you have to go to Gludin in Aden to change your occupation. The only way to get to Gludin is with the services of <font color="LEVEL">Gatekeeper Tamil</font>. You can pay the fare in adena, or else perform a service for Tamil.
