Start out by hunting <font color="LEVEL">elder keltirs</font> or <font color="LEVEL">wolves</font> near the village and magic school. Since your spells are where your power lies, look for monsters you can defeat with a single spell until you reach level 3 or so.
<br>
When you make it to level 6, you should leave the village by the western gates and try hunting <font color="LEVEL">Orcs</font>. The important rule at these levels, is to <font color="LEVEL">hunt the strongest monster you can defeat with two Wind Strikes.</font> But remember, Orcs are more dangerous than they appear, because if you hit one, more will often come to its aid.
