<html><head><body>Trader Unoren:<br>I give you my deepest gratitude. Go immediately to the <font color="LEVEL">Underground Fortress</font> and bring me <font color="LEVEL">ten undead bone fragments and three Elf skulls</font>. The skulls must be whole and intact, with no flaws. According to Sorcerer Esrandell, flawless and unscarred Elf skulls may only be obtained from the monsters called the <font color="LEVEL">dark terrors</font>. Dark terror, mist terror and shade horror ... they are all related.<br>I wish to present my fellow soldiers, who have suffered long enough, with eternal peace as soon as possible. Please. Hurry.</body></html>
