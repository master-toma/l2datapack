Sir Lich King Icarus:<br>Did you say Hardin...? I've been friends with that guy for a very long time... But I still don't know much about him. Sometimes he leaves this academy and goes out for a long time. And when he does that, even I don't know where or what he's doing. But that is something that would definitely surprise an ordinary person like yourself...<br>Based on Human standards, he acts very properly and justly.

I believe that someone like him is in a region that is not effected by laws, norms and ethics...<br><a action="link lich_king_icarus001.htm">Go back.</a></body></html>
