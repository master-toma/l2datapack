<html><head><body>Paagrio Lord Kakai:<br>Ages ago, the seven tribes of the Orc race ruled the world. However, 2,000 years ago, we fought for control with the treacherous Elves and went to war. Of course, our strength far surpassed any other single race's, but the Elves drew the scheming Humans to their side and, in the end, we were defeated and driven out. But the haughty Elves were betrayed by the Humans and chased deep into the forest. You may be assured, they dug their own grave.<br>After that defeat, we constructed our new home, here on the <font color="LEVEL">Immortal Plateau</font>, which used to be the castle grounds of Paagrio. We are diligently preparing for the time when the Orcs will again flourish. But in the meantime, one of the seven tribes, the <font color="LEVEL">Lagra Tribe</font>, betrayed the others and stained our honor by leaving us. The traitors must not be forgiven! They are a disgraceful clan that has trampled our dignity into the dust. They do not deserve to be called Orcs.<br><a action="link kakai_the_lord_of_flame001.htm">Return</a></body></html>
