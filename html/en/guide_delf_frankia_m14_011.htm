I see. You have chosen a lonely and dangerous path, but it does have its own rewards. If you intend to hunt alone, there are things that you must know.
<br>
First you must learn to time your battles wisely. As your level increases, you will find you need more and more rest between battles. Look for ways to decrease the amount of time spent resting. In the long term, winning a great amount of experience from a single enemy is of lesser value than being able to defeat more moderate monsters at a steady pace. Therefore, <font color="LEVEL">battle weak monsters -- indicated by blue-green names in the target window -- when hunting alone.</font>
<br>
Next, when hunting solo, you must have the ability to deal with unexpected situations. That is why <font color="LEVEL">lesser healing potions</font> are a must. If you have a good supply of lesser healing potions you can use them to reduce the time needed for resting, but make sure to always hold a couple back in reserve, in case a potentially fatal emergency arises.
