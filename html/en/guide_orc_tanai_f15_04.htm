We need to talk about how to apply your skills in battle. I'm going to explain about <font color="LEVEL">disrupting magic</font>. You may have already seen greystone golems give up on casting a spell when they take damage while casting. Well, it's not just golems who do that, it applies to every magic-using monster.
<br>
The more damage you do to the casting monster, the better your chance of interrupting the spell. If you learn the right timing, you can use this tactic to defeat magic-using monsters that are much stronger than you are.
<br>
Also, be aware of the <font color="LEVEL">critical strike</font> ability which is gained from Power Strike and Iron Fist. A critical strike occurs when either of these skills are used for the final blow against a monster. Since the experience you gain from a monster is affected by how much damage you inflict with the final blow, you may increase your experience reward by <font color="LEVEL">using one of these skills when the enemy's HP is near zero</font>.
