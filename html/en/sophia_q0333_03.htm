Mercenary Sophia:<br>Dear brother of the Black Lion.  Our current situation is as follows.  As I said before, our current mission is to drive out the evil spirits in this area.  However, since the main force of the mercenary troop has been dispatched to Gludio, our military force is suffering a shortage.  The only thing we are managing to do right now is to contain the evil spirits from attacking the village. <br>Fortunately, Captain Leopold of Gludin has sent many newly selected mercenary brothers.  So we can launch our attack on the stronghold of the evil spirits in earnest.  Brother, I would like you to join us in this fight.<br><a action="bypass -h quest_accept?quest_id=<?quest_id?>">Tell him that you will join them in the fight.</a></body></html>
