First Elder Lockirin:
<br>
This clay tablet... Where in the world could...?! It's just one part, but... Maphr...!
<br>
Look at this, young fellow! Where in the world did you find this? If you can gather the other pieces too and assemble them into a single item, I'll give you something great in gratitude! I promise in the name of the first elder of the guild federation!
