<html><head><body>Now's a good time to hunt <font color="LEVEL">kasha timber wolves, goblin grave robbers and rakeclaw imps</font>. When you reach level 11 or so, switch to <font color="LEVEL">werewolves and darkwing bats</font>.<br>For kasha wolves and kasha timber wolves, take the north road out of the village, then take the southwest road at the fork. You might also find them at the first fork in the south road. In fact, if it's not too crowded, I recommend you try the south road first.<br>Take the northeastern road, or walk southwest from the end of the south road, to find goblins. For imps, head east. You can fight the common monsters from level 6 or so, and the leaders when you gain a bit more experience.<br><a action="link guide_orc_tanai_m14.htm">Return</a></body></html>
