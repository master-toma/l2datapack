<html><head><body>We need to talk about how to apply your skills in battle. I'm going to explain about <font color="LEVEL">disrupting magic</font>. You may have already seen greystone golems give up on casting a spell when they take damage while casting. Well, it's not just stone golems who do that, it applies to every monster that uses magic.<br>There's nothing more you can learn from the Seers here.

You have some amazing things to learn.<br><a action="link guide_orc_tanai_m20.htm">Return</a></body></html>
