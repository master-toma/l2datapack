So, have you been to the <font color="LEVEL">Obelisk of Victory</font> yet? It was built by the Elves and lies north of the village, to the left. It's in the middle of a nice hunting ground if you're around level 7. There are plenty of orcs and werewolves there. At your level you should be able to hold your own against orcs, orc fighters, and werewolves.
<br>
Just remember to be careful around <font color="LEVEL">orc fighters,</font> they'll attack you before you attack them, unlike other monsters.
<br>
Once you reach level 10, go south of the magic school or north from the obelisk to hunt werewolf hunters and chieftains, and stone golems. <a action="link guide_human_cnacelot_m14.htm">Return</a>
