What did you do with your old weapons when you bought new ones? Did you sell them to a merchant? You might have received a better price if you had sold them to other adventurers. You can often buy gear for a better price from other adventurers than from a store. Try clicking the <font color="LEVEL">Trade</font> tab on the bottom left of the Chat window. You will probably find it to be filled with messages from adventurers like yourself, buying and selling goods. Try making your next purchase from someone here. Or, you may prefer to use <font color="LEVEL">Private Store</font> on the Action tab. The Private Store has Buy and Sell options.
<br>
For the <font color="LEVEL">Sell</font> option, execute the Sell action, then select the item you wish to sell.  Set its price and enter a message, then press Start. It sells itself automatically, which comes in very handy.
<br>
And for the <font color="LEVEL">Buy</font> option, execute the Buy action, then select the item you wish to buy, its price, and quantity, then press Start. But if you do not currently possess the item you wish to buy, you will not be able to purchase that item. Dwarves may register up to 5 different items on the Buy list, while other races may register up to 4 items.
