Grand Master Rains:
<br>
To become an Elven Ranger, you must prove your ability. Elven Rangers are tested by <font color="LEVEL">Master Reisa</font> of our guild, who has trained Elven Rangers for a long time. Yes, that is her over there. She will assign you an appropriate task. To become an Elven Ranger, you must pass her test and bring back her letter of recommendation.
