Oh, hello! Have you completed your mission for <font color="LEVEL">Tetrarch Thifiell</font> yet? It is very important that you complete this task.
<br>
You should also see <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith Karrod</font>. I suspect he has troubles that need to be dealt with. I'm sure that if you aid him, he'll be most generous.
<br>
Look up <font color="LEVEL">Trader Minaless</font> as well. She is looking for a supply of zombie dust, and by dealing with her you can increase the profit from hunting marsh zombies.
