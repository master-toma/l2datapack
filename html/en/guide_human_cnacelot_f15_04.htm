We need to talk about how to apply your skills in battle. I'm going to explain about <font color="LEVEL">disrupting magic</font>. You may have already seen stone golems give up on casting a spell when they take damage while casting. Well, it's not just stone golems who do that, it applies to every monster that uses magic.
<br>
The more damage you do to the casting monster, the better your chance of interrupting the spell. If you learn the right timing, you can use this tactic to defeat magic-using monsters that are much stronger than you are.
