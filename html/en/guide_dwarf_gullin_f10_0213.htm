<font color="LEVEL">Two-handed blunts weapons and two-handed swords</font> tell the world, "I'm a powerful warrior, better not mess with me," don't you think? Well, it stands to reason that swinging a weapon with both hands makes it inflict more damage, and gives you a good reach in combat as well. The problem is, their attack speed is very slow.

They're a good choice, if you like a good brawl. They're expensive, though, so you might not be able to afford one for awhile. Oh, and of course all the differences between one-handed swords and one-handed blunt weapons still apply to their two-handed counterparts.
