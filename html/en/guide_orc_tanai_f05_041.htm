If you use your head while hunting, you should have about 60 SP by the time you reach level 5. The Prefects can tell you the skills in which you can train.
<br>
Skills are divided into active skills and passive skills. <font color="LEVEL">Active skills</font> require that you intentionally use them, while <font color="LEVEL">passive skills</font> increase your basic abilities from the moment you learn them. At level 5, you'll want to learn active offensive skills first. <font color="LEVEL">Power Strike and Iron Fist</font> are your choices. Power Strike is for those who fight with a <font color="LEVEL">sword</font>, Iron Fist for <font color="LEVEL">hand-to-hand</font> Fighters.
