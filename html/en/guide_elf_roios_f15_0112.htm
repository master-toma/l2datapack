It requires serious preparation to be an effective part of a group. Experience is the best teacher, but I can tell you some of the basics.

A monster usually concentrates its attacks on the person who has injured it the most. Therefore, if you are in a party with another Fighter, try to trade off dealing the majority of the damage, so the monster divides its attacks between the two of you and nobody has to take all the damage. The best way to do this, of course, is to <font color="LEVEL">take turns attacking the monster in close combat.</font>
