Hierarch Asterios:
<br>
This place was the home of the Elves of light, who lived in peace with the forest under the protection of The Mother Tree Glade. It was a nest to our race -- long isolated from the world and surrounded by a protective shield of power. However, the Sea of Spores is slowly expanding its corrupt domain, and the dark brothers to the North and the Human kingdom to the south look down on our forest. These days, many young elves are leaving the forest, saying they cannot live as captives any longer, and are entering the outside world.
<br>
The times demand change, and we can no longer depend solely on the protection of the forest. Now our race must mingle in the larger world and, above all else, understand the Humans, who have secured domination of the continent. For these reasons, only Elves that have experience and understanding of the outside world have the qualifications to gain new powers.
