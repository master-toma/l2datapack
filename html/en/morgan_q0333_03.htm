Guild Member Morgan:<br>It's a freight box of our commercial guild!? It is freight that was stolen from our carts having been attacked by evil creatures recently. But there is a lot of freight that was looted and so our losses are really big. Still, it is really fortunate that you could recover this part.<br>As a representative of the commercial guild, I thank you for your efforts. Here, take this gift of gratitude, even though it's not much. And I present you with these <font color="LEVEL">coins from our guild</font>. It's like a plaque of appreciation that we give to people that have contributed to the commercial guild.<br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=333&reply=2">Go back.</a></body></html>
