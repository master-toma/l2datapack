<html><head><body>Upper and lower body armor is classified as either <font color="LEVEL">robes</font>, <font color="LEVEL">light gear </font> or <font color="LEVEL">heavy gear</font>. Robes are for Mystics and that ilk, so we'll skip them and move directly to light and heavy gear.<br>When you select a profession at level 20, the armor you wear will influence your choice of skills. For example, the Human Knight's Heavy Armor Mastery is a skill which increases defense only when heavy gear is worn. Likewise, the Rogue's Light Armor Mastery increases evasion when wearing light gear.<br>Keep in mind, you are only considered to be equipped with a given type of armor if <font color="LEVEL">both the upper and lower body are equipped with the same armor type</font>. Heavy Armor Mastery, for example, will not activate if you are equipped with, say, a bronze breastplate and leather pants.<br>These skills are only affected by your upper and lower body armor. Your helmet, gloves and other gear do not signify, so wear what you wish of those types.<br><a action="link guide_human_cnacelot_f20_02.htm">Return</a></body></html>
