Have you gained a combat skill yet? You'll recall I advised either Power Strike or Mortal Blow, depending on your choice of weapon.
<br>
As a rule, novices acquire an attack skill first, then next learn support skills like <font color="LEVEL">Aura Defense</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Aura Attack</font>, and then passive skills like <font color="LEVEL">Weapon Mastery</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Armor Mastery</font> after that. It is, of course, your choice to make, but my personal preference is to obtain Weapon Mastery first. Either Mastery skill will come in most useful, though.
<br>
You may upgrade the skills you have learned when you reach level 10. It is wise, of course, to increase the skills you're already using most.
<br>
You will find that learning to effectively use a bow will make a great difference in the way you hunt, but doing so will require both adena and MP, so train yourself wisely.
