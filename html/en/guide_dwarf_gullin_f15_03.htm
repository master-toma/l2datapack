<html><head><body>If you think you're ready for tougher battles, cross the river near the village and head east. Cross the second river to the east to find a good hunting ground for <font color="LEVEL">Utuku Orcs, garum werewolves, goblin brigands</font> and others. Or if you want, you can follow the river north, and stay on the right side of the mountains to find <font color="LEVEL">blade bats, goblin brigand sub leaders, magical weavers</font> and such lot.<br>The Spine Mine area is a range of mountains running north and south, and new monsters wait inside every mountain, so if you've had enough of our little valley, try going over the mountains to the east.<br><a action="link guide_dwarf_gullin_f15.htm">Return</a></body></html>
