Hello there!  An important person has come back!  Since Grade 1 members have the privilege of dealing with many rare coins, many members are desiring to become Grade 1.  However, the number of Grade 1 members is limited.  To put it simply, I’m saying that Grade 1 membership is not given to just anybody who asks for it.  Therefore, you should be extra careful in your words and deeds.  Well now, is there anything I can help you with?
