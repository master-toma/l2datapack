Guard Chief Kurt:
<br>
This place Aden Castle was built in the architectural style of the era of titans and is held up by enormous columns so that it is surrounded in an aura of invincibility. I'd say it is nearly impossible to attack it militarily. Even if all the armies of Elmore converged, this castle could be adequately defended with just five thousand men...
<br>
But a castle like this is weak to internal dangers... The task of us guards is to protect against factors and risks of destruction from other countries... and to keep out in advance the people that would bring harm to the city.
