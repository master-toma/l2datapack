Fighters around your level usually have good luck near the <font color="LEVEL">Obelisk of Victory</font> in the middle of the island. The stretch to the west of the obelisk is an especially good hunting ground, with plenty of orcs and werewolves. That's the perfect place to fulfill Captain Gilbert's mission.
<br>
If you don't feel ready for that region, or if it's just too crowded, travel south from the obelisk and cross the river. The monsters aren't quite as tough there, and there are no orc fighters, which makes things a good deal easier.
<br>
Finally, there are lots of <font color="LEVEL">stone golems and werewolves</font> to be found by following the seashore towards the northwest of the village. Stone golems are hard to defend against if you don't have a good defense against magic, but if you learn to use Power Strike or similer skills with proper timing, you can take them out quickly enough that your defense shouldn't matter.
