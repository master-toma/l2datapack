To refine your profession, you'll have to leave the Spine Mines for <font color="LEVEL">Gludin</font>, the port city of Aden, because that's the center of all trade for the continent. Talk to <font color="LEVEL">Warehouse Chief Reed</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Head Blacksmith Bronk</font> and they'll tell you more.
<br>
By now, you should know that the only way to get to Gludin is to seek the services of <font color="LEVEL">Gatekeeper Wirphy</font>, since the land and sea routes to Aden are blocked by the atmospheric disturbances between Aden and Elmore. You can pay Wirphy for the journey, or she may let you through if you run a little errand for her.
