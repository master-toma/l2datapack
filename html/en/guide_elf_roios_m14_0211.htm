You've probably noticed that Mystic and Fighter weapons are sold separately. Even if they seem to be of the the same type, there are subtle differences.

<font color="LEVEL">Fighter weapons cause heavy damage but possess low magic attack power, while with Mystic weapons the ratio is reversed.</font> However, Fighter weapons do have some weak magical ability, and if you are a Mystic with a taste for hand-to-hand combat, you may use a sword instead of a staff.
