Master Ellenia:

I congratulate you upon your safe return, Fighter of the forest. Have you given the enemy of our race a harsh punishment they will not soon forget?

According to the terms of our contract, I will reward you according to the number of fangs you have brought. I hope you will continue to fight for the brothers of the forest.
