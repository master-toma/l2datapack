His name is <font color="LEVEL">Darin</font>, and he seems to be worried about something. Why don't you see if he could use your help? He could at least use someone to talk to, I think.<br>Also, <font color="LEVEL">Guard Arnold</font>, stationed at the south gate of the village, is looking for someone to deliver items he recovered from a shipwreck. I believe he's willing to pay, so see what you can do for him.<br>Have you been to the weapon shop yet? <font color="LEVEL">Trader Lector, keeper of the weapon store</font>, is a famous leatherworker.

He can fill you in on the details.<br><a action="link guide_human_cnacelot_f05.htm">Return</a></body></html>
