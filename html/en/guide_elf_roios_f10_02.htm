At level 6, your most important task is to find better weapons. Consider the weapon you are wielding now, then think how you wish to improve it.
<br>
If you prefer to wield a dagger, seek to obtain a <font color="LEVEL">bone dagger</font>. A doom dagger is even better, but will be quite expensive. A bone dagger will do. If you prefer the sword, buy a <font color="LEVEL">small sword</font>, or a broadsword if you have the money to spend. If blunt weapons suit you, you'll do fine with a <font color="LEVEL">club</font>. Blunt weapons have a high accuracy, and those who use them may learn stun skills.
<br>
Whatever you choose for close combat, try to get a bow as well, if you can. Bows allow you to draw monsters to you by attacking them from a distance and are very useful to us swift Elves.
<br>
At levels 9-10, you may have enough money to buy the next set of weapons, but it may be wise to be patient and wait.  At level 10 <font color="LEVEL">Sentinel Kendell</font> will ask for your help. You never know if he will find you weapons that you need if you agree to his request.
