<html><head><body>At level 6, your most important task is to find better weapons. Consider the weapon you are wielding now, then think how you wish to improve it.<br>If a dagger is your choice, seek to obtain a <font color="LEVEL">bone dagger</font>. A doom dagger is even better, but will be quite expensive. A bone dagger will do. If you prefer the sword, buy a <font color="LEVEL">small sword</font>, or a broadsword if you have the adena to spend. If blunt weapons suit you, you'll do fine with a <font color="LEVEL">club</font>. Blunt weapons have a high accuracy, and those who use them may learn stun skills.<br>Whatever you choose for close combat, try to get a bow as well, if you can. Bows allow you to draw monsters to you by attacking them from a distance. And only those who have used Power Shot in combat can truly appreciate its formidable power in battle. Of course, Power Shot also consumes a formidable amount of MP when used, so take care.<br>Around level 9 or 10 you should have enough money to purchase better weapons, but you should speak to Grand Master Roien about weapons before you buy any.<br><a action="link guide_human_cnacelot_f10_021.htm">I want to know about the characteristics of each weapon type.</a><br><a action="link guide_human_cnacelot_f10_022.htm">I want to know about armor.</a><br><a action="link guide_human_cnacelot_f10.htm">Return</a></body></html>
