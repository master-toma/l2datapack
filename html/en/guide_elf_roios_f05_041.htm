If you have been alert, you may have noticed that when you defeat monsters, you gain <font color="LEVEL">SP</font> along with experience. SP stands for <font color="LEVEL">'skill points'</font>. If you are curious about your SP, click the <font color="LEVEL">Character Status</font> button and view the <font color="LEVEL">Status</font> tab on the window. You must expend SP for each individual skill you acquire.
