Guard Stan:<br>Aside from collecting coins, this game is very fun to play.  You can say that it gives a sparkle of joy to my life especially for a guard whose job is truly boring.  I will hide three coins, and you will guess and tell me what they are in correct order.  Then I’ll tell you how many correct answers you gave me.  We will repeat this several times and each time, you will try to come up with a correct answer.  Whenever you come up with a correct answer, you win and whenever you give an incorrect answer, I win.<br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=336&reply=22">Return to the beginning.</a></body></html>
