<html><head><body>You can begin to learn skills when you reach level 5. You will receive instruction in new skills at the Warrior Guild, which is the room on the right when you enter the House of the King, the biggest building in the village, right in the center of town. The Prefects there will teach you your skills.<br>Now, pay attention; you'll need <font color="LEVEL">SP</font> to gain your skills. SP is short for <font color="LEVEL">"skill points"</font>, and they're earned along with experience whenever you defeat a monster. SP are deducted whenever you learn a new skill. You can check your SP by clicking the <font color="LEVEL">Character Status</font> button, then on the <font color="LEVEL">Status</font> tab in the window. Of course, the number of SP you need will vary, depending on the skill you're after.<br><a action="link guide_orc_tanai_f05_041.htm">I want to know more about skills.</a><br><a action="link guide_orc_tanai_f05.htm">Return</a></body></html>
