As soon as you save enough money, you should buy an <font color="LEVEL">apprentice's spellbook</font>. Check the Chat and Trade windows regularly ... the best way to find quality items at a reasonable price is to buy them from other adventurers.

When you reach Level 13 or 14 try to purchase a <font color="LEVEL">cedar staff</font>. If you haven't saved enough cash, you may have some decent weapons to sell that you've obtained from monsters.

Too often, Mystics become careless about their defense, since their combat strategy is based on not getting hit by enemies at all. Still, it is prudent to have at least hose and tunic at Level 8, and a feriotic hose and tunic by Level 13 or 14. They can save you from the unexpected.
