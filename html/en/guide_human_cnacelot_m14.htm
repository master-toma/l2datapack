My word, I must say you've been doing well enough so far. However, you have not yet been called upon to use your brain a great deal. From now on it will take wisdom and cunning to survive. In particular, you must make wise choices when it comes to your equipment and skills. Pay attention to what I tell you now, for it is very important to your survival. And come see me again when you reach level 15, for I will have more to teach you at that time.
