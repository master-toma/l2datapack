<br>
At last you have reached level 19! Congratulations!
<br>
You may select your first professional upgrade at level 19. However, you must reach <font color="LEVEL">level 20</font> for the change to actually take effect, no matter which quest you are on.
<br>
A Human Fighter may change to a Warrior, a Human Knight, or a Rogue. For further information go visit the <font color="LEVEL">Grand Master</font> of the nearest village. The Grand Master can be found in the Warriors Guild, where you learn your skills.
