Priest Dustin:
<br>
Welcome, young friend, to the holy grounds of Einhasad. The Priests here teach Mystics the mysteries of the miraculous light granted to us by the gods.
<br>
The magical powers of light must only be used for healing and protection. However, there are those who forget this basic principle, and use the divine power as a tool of war. I believe that you will not be guilty of such an error, and so I will teach you. Please do not make me regret my faith in you.
