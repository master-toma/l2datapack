At last you have reached level 19! Congratulations!
<br>
You may select your first professional upgrade at level 19. However, you must reach <font color="LEVEL">level 20</font> for the change to actually take effect, no matter which quest you are on.

An Orc Mystic may change to an Orc Shaman. For further information go visit the <font color="LEVEL">High Prefects</font> of the nearest village. The High Prefect stands near the Prefects where you learn your skills.
