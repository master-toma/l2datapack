OK, shall I demonstrate my talents now? Well, this fragment looks like it goes to the very bottom section of the stone tablet... And this piece is above that... It's like putting together a puzzle... OK... It's finished! It's an ancient stone tablet... I'm really curious whether some secrets of history are recorded on it! Hmm... But these letters look like writing of the titans... I've seen this somewhere before...! Where in the world could...?!
