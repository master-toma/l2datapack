Blacksmith Rupio:<br>OK, shall I demonstrate my talents now? Well, this fragment looks like it goes to the very bottom section of the stone tablet... And this piece is above that... Oh! The tablet just crumbled... I should have expected that the material would be really weak from having been exposed to the rain and wind for such a long time... Darn...! I'm really sorry for making such a big mistake.</body></html>
