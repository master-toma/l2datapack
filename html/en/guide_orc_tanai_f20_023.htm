Have you encountered <font color="LEVEL">soulshot</font> yet in your adventures?
<br>
It is a form of magical <font color="LEVEL">ammunition</font> created by the Dwarves. You can use it like a potion while engaged in armed combat. It allows you to inflict greater damage, but it disappears when used.
<br>
Around Level 15 you will be able to acquire weapons that use soulshot. A soulshot rated better than x1 will increase the damage for the number of shots indicated.
