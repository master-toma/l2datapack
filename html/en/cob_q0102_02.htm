Master Cobendell:
<br>
The Sea of Spores was where the fiercest battles occurred a thousand years ago, during the battle between Humans and the Elves. It was once a beautiful forest, but the effects of the strong magic cast by Mystics of both sides caused all of the forest spirits to perish or mutate, and the land became barren. Instead of lush trees, the forest became the "Sea of Spores," full of mushrooms and fungi that emit dangerous poisons.
<br>
Adria has fallen severely ill since her visit there. She has been infected by the poison of the spores. Thankfully, she has recovered after being treated with my potion. But the Sentinels that traveled with Adria may also have become infected. To prevent the poison from spreading throughout the village, we must hurry to create a <font color="LEVEL">remedy</font>. But I do not have enough materials to create the potion.
