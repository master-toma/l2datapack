Carrier Torocco:<br>Blast... What should I do? What should I do? How can I ever get that diamond back? I am in so much trouble... Gouph will kill me... What should I do?<br>...What the?! Who are you? How long have you been there? Did Gouph sent you?? Agghh... I’m sorry! Please forgive me....!!! I don't know what to do!!! I lost the legendary Star Diamond, that was my responsibility!!! I dishonored the Carriers, who are famous for their competence... My guild will excommunicate me... I won't be able to pay off the expensive fines even if I worked for the rest of my life? My colleagues and my family will laugh at me... Aghh... This is the end of my life!<br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=108&reply=1">Ask what happened.</a></body></html>
