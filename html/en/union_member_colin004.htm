The best place here is the Enchanted Valley! Leave the town by the north-west exit, you will reach there right away. The scenery is wonderful and you will find unique things to hunt. Even though our union has the priority to hunt, we don't stop others from hunting. However, it is quite a rough place to hunt...
<br>
Besides that, the Forest of Mirrors is located in the east and the Valley of Dragons to the south. Both places are as rough as the Enchanted Valley. If you want to know more, you should go there... Hey, but be careful, I don't want to retrieve your dead bodies!
