Darin:
<br>
Do you know what is more dangerous than a Knight's sword or a Mystic’s spell? It is love. It comes unexpectedly and swallows a man’s soul, and never lets go. This thing called ‘love’ which once I'd only heard about in ballads or gossip, yes, that is what makes me so happy and agonized these days. Do you understand what I’m saying?
<br>
How could you? You undoubtedly have larger ambitions than that. But remember... someday, when you least expect it, an aching love may find its way into your heart.
