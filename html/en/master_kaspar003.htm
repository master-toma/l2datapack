Master Kaspar:<br>Do you mean Icarus? All the students, including me, feared him. Perhaps it's because he's an undead or something but he neither eats nor sleeps. But the magic that he holds -- in particular, his knowledge about necromancy -- is clearly the greatest in the land.<br>He appears to be going around freely but it is said that he is actually being invisibly constrained by Master Hardin. Therefore, he still teaches various things to us in a friendly way...<br>But, well, this is just my feeling about the matter... Even if he wasn't restrained, I am sure he would continue to teach us for the time being. It's not that he, who is an undead, feels the any particular love... It's for another reason...<a action="link master_kaspar001.htm">Go back.</a></body></html>
