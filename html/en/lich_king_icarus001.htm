Sir Lich King Icarus:
<br>
I haven't seen you before... You've got a face that overflows with vitality. Your face, your expression... I really like you... If it's OK with you, I'd like to check out how you are on the inside too...
<br>
Ah, your nonsensical expression is just excellent! Anyway, it's nice to meet you... I am Icarus. I've forgotten what my name was when I was alive... I am the only one of the thirteen Lich kings who shook the Elmoreden Kingdom long ago that is still alive... Well, to say that I'm a survivor is really a misuse of the word. Hee, hee...
