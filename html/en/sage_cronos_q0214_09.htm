Sage Cronos<br>There was this book that I wrote  for pastime 100 years ago. And then a stupid guy named the book 'The Scripture of Knowledge'. But the book disappeared 20 years ago. I don't know if somebody stole it or I left it somewhere. I want you to find that book.<br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=214&reply=9">"Where on earth do you expect me to find that book?"</a></body></html>
