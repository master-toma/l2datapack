At Level 6, your most important task is to find better weapons. Consider the weapon you are wielding now, then think how you wish to improve it.
<br>
If you prefer to wield a dagger, seek to obtain a <font color="LEVEL">bone dagger</font>. A doomed dagger is even better, but will be quite expensive. A bone dagger will do for now. If you prefer the sword, buy a <font color="LEVEL">small sword</font>, or a broadsword if you have the money to spend. If blunt weapons suit you, you'll do fine with a <font color="LEVEL">club</font>. Blunt weapons have a high accuracy, and those who use them may learn stun skills.
<br>
Whatever you choose for close combat, try to get a bow as well, if you can. Bows allow you to draw monsters to you by attacking them from a distance. And only those who have used Power Shot in combat can truly appreciate its formidable power in battle. Of course, Power Shot also consumes a formidable amount of MP when used, so take care.
<br>
At Level 10, you may have enough money to buy a full set of your next weapons, but you may wish to exercise patience, at least until you seek out Tetrarch Thifiell, who will speak to you on the subject of weapons.
