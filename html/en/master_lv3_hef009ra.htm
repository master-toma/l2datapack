To be a Mercenary, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of the Seeker, the Mark of Trust, and the Mark of the Searcher. You did collect all of the marks, but your level is not high enough.
<br>
You have done well collecting the them, but you need to come back after more training. When you become level 40, I shall change your occupation to a Mercenary.
